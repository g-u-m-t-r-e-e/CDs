PROCEPT BioRobotics - Investment Dossier

**Company**: PROCEPT BioRobotics Corporation (PRCT)
**Date**: 2025-08-26
**Model**: claude-opus-4-1-20250805
**Prompt**: Company Dossier v3.2

### 1) Executive Summary

PROCEPT BioRobotics is a robotic surgery company focused on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment through its proprietary Aquablation therapy delivered via the AquaBeam and next-generation HYDROS robotic systems [1]. The company targets the $18.5B BPH treatment market with over 150 peer-reviewed publications supporting its technology [2][3]. Investment thesis: Strong revenue growth (65% in 2024) and expanding margins position PRCT as the leader in robotic BPH treatment, but rising competition from Intuitive Surgical and execution risks around international expansion and the prostate cancer pivot create near-term volatility [4][5]. Key value drivers include HYDROS commercial rollout, international expansion (104% growth in Q1 2025), and the WATER IV prostate cancer trial [6][7]. Primary risks include competitive pressure, leadership transition uncertainty, and dependence on U.S. market adoption.

### 8) Investment View / Takeaways

PROCEPT BioRobotics represents a compelling growth story in surgical robotics with demonstrated commercial traction and a clear path to profitability. The company's 65% revenue growth, expanding margins (65% gross margin in Q1 2025), and approaching EBITDA breakeven validate the commercial opportunity in robotic BPH treatment. The HYDROS platform launch and international expansion provide multiple growth vectors, while the WATER IV prostate cancer trial offers significant upside optionality. However, increased competition from Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci SP system and leadership transition risks create near-term headwinds. The stock appears fairly valued at current levels given execution risks, but successful HYDROS rollout and positive prostate cancer trial data could drive meaningful rerating. Recommend HOLD with positive bias, monitoring Q3-Q4 2025 catalysts for potential upgrade.

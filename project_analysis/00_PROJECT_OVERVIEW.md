## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Current Workflow
```bash
# Generate dossier
/task biotech-investment-dossier "Create dossier for [TICKER]"

# Audit dossier
/task biotech-dossier-qc-auditor "Audit [TICKER] dossier"
```

### With Configuration Updates
- Both agents now require ULTRATHINK reasoning
- Mandatory 30+ websearch queries for creation
- Mandatory 20+ websearch validations for audit
- "UNKNOWN—PRIMARY REQUIRED" for missing data

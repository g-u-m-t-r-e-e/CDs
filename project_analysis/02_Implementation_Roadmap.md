    # Step 2: Generate via ChatGPT 5 Pro
    raw_dossier = chatgpt5_pro.generate(
        prompt=ENHANCED_DOSAG_PROMPT,
        context=sources
    )
    
    # Step 3: Audit via Claude CLI
    audit_report = claude_cli.audit(
        agent="biotech-dossier-qc-auditor",
        dossier=raw_dossier
    )
    
    # Step 4: Human review if critical issues
    if audit_report.has_critical_issues():
        return human_review_queue.add(raw_dossier)
    
    # Step 5: Auto-approve and distribute
    return distribute_to_team(raw_dossier)
```

## 1) Executive Summary

Eli Lilly stands as the global leader in diabetes and obesity care, with its dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) driving transformational growth and market share capture from Novo Nordisk. The company operates a diversified portfolio spanning neuroscience (Alzheimer's), oncology (CDK4/6 inhibitors), and immunology (IL-13 inhibition). Investment thesis centers on the exceptional growth trajectory of incretin medicines driving 38% revenue growth in Q2 2025 [1] with raised 2025 guidance of $60-62B, while maintaining leadership in high-value therapeutic areas with significant pipeline depth including oral GLP-1 (orforglipron) and next-generation triple agonist (retatrutide).

Bull case: Dominant positioning in a $100B+ TAM obesity market by 2030 [2], superior clinical profile vs competitors, robust manufacturing investments ($9B in Indiana facility) [3], and multiple pipeline catalysts. Bear case: Intense competition from Novo Nordisk and emerging players, pricing pressure from Medicare negotiations post-2027 [4], high manufacturing capex requirements, and regulatory risks for next-generation assets.

Key value drivers: GLP-1 franchise expansion, oral formulation launch, manufacturing scale-up. Key risks: Supply chain constraints, competitive erosion, pricing pressure.

## 8) Investment View / Takeaways

Eli Lilly represents a compelling growth story at the intersection of multiple large addressable markets driven by demographic tailwinds. The company has successfully executed on the tirzepatide launch, gaining meaningful market share from Novo Nordisk while demonstrating superior clinical efficacy. The upcoming orforglipron oral GLP-1 launch represents a potential paradigm shift that could dramatically expand market access and patient convenience, supporting premium valuations.

The diversified pipeline across neuroscience, oncology, and immunology provides multiple shots-on-goal beyond the incretin franchise, with recent acquisitions (Scorpion, $2.5B) demonstrating strategic capital allocation. Strong financial metrics (85% gross margins, positive cash flow) support continued aggressive R&D investment and manufacturing scale-up.

Key risks center on competitive intensity and pricing pressure, particularly post-2027 Medicare negotiations. However, the breadth of pipeline assets, manufacturing investments, and first-mover advantage in oral GLP-1 delivery position Lilly as a long-term winner in the evolving metabolic health landscape.

**Investment recommendation: BUY** - Lilly trades at a premium but justified by superior growth trajectory, pipeline depth, and market-leading position in high-growth therapeutic areas. The 2025-2026 period represents a critical inflection point with multiple pipeline catalysts that could drive sustained outperformance.

## Issues Found

| Section | Issue | Severity | Evidence | Correction |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|------------|
| Executive Summary | Model reference incorrect | Minor | Dossier states "claude-sonnet-4-20250514" but should be "claude-opus-4-1-20250805" per v3.2 spec | Update model field to match prompt requirements |
| Key Developments | EMA validation date incorrect | Major | Dossier states "2025-02-27" for EMA MAA validation, but WebSearch confirms it was March 27, 2025 | Correct date to 2025-03-27 |
| Catalysts | R&D Day date appears future-dated | Minor | Listed as 2025-06-26 but this is past current date (2025-08-26) | Verify if event occurred or move to past developments |
| Programs/Pipeline | Incorrect competitor reference for CAH | Major | States "Spruce Biosciences teplizumab - failed Phase 3 2021" but teplizumab is for Type 1 diabetes, not CAH. Spruce's CAH drug was tildacerfont | Correct to "Spruce Biosciences tildacerfont - failed Phase 2 trials 2024" |
| Financials | Minor burn rate precision | Minor | States "~$77M per quarter (Q3 2024)" but actual Q3 2024 net loss was $76.8M | Update to "$76.8M net loss (Q3 2024)" for precision |
| Financials | Cash position timing | Minor | States cash as of "December 31, 2024" but should verify if this is projected | Verify actual reporting date for $1.4B cash figure |
| Competitive Landscape | Sandostatin launch year imprecision | Minor | States "market leader since 1988" - Sandostatin was approved in 1988, but LAR formulation launched 1998-1999 | Clarify "Sandostatin approved 1988, LAR formulation since 1998" |
| Bull/Bear Views | Partnership revenue interpretation | Major | States "Limited partnership validation with only $1M licensing revenue" but this was down from $4M in 2023, not inherently limited | Reframe as "Declining licensing revenue ($1M vs $4M in 2023)" |
| Citations | Missing primary sources for some claims | Minor | Some market size figures cite secondary sources when primary research reports available | Upgrade to primary sources where possible |
